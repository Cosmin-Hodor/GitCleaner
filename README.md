## How to

- Navigate to the directory of the Git repository where you want to delete branches.
- Open a terminal window and execute the shell script by typing "./script.sh" (assuming the name of the script is "script.sh").
- When prompted, enter the names of the branches you want to keep, separated by commas.
- The script will then delete all branches in the repository, except the ones you specified, both locally and remotely. The script will print a message to the console for each branch that is deleted.
- Once the script has completed running, you can verify that the branches have been deleted by running the "git branch" command.
